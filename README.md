### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anden, a junior at Ohio State studying Computer Science & Engineering. I have dabbled in basically everything, but am most interested in web development, robotics, and general software development. I will be interning with [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) Summer 2021, but am always open to offers! Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nlJzHsSkNTlFM0Xu_uAItzb8M-6_duzt/view?usp=sharing) for a quick overview of my work and accomplishments.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on optimizing 3D printing procedures for the [Ohio State Center for Design & Manufacturing Excellence](https://cdme.osu.edu/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about game development with C# and information security.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always open to inquiries and would love to grab a coffee or have a chat with you about anything and everything.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at andenacitelli@gmail.com. 
- âš¡ Outside of programming, I love to play the guitar and cook.
