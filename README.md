### Hey! 👋

I'm Anden, a junior at Ohio State studying Computer Science & Engineering. Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nlJzHsSkNTlFM0Xu_uAItzb8M-6_duzt/view?usp=sharing) or just scroll through my GitHub for a quick overview of what I'm about. I will be interning with [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) doing Software Engineering this upcoming summer, but am open to full-time opportunities after I graduate (likely Fall 2021); get in contact via the email listed below!

- 🔭 I’m currently developing 3D printing procedures for the [Ohio State Center for Design & Manufacturing Excellence](https://cdme.osu.edu/) and leading software development for Ohio State's Underwater Robotics Team ([@osu-uwrt](http://github.com/osu-uwrt)) while progressing through my normal courseload as a student.
- 📫 You can reach me at andenacitelli@gmail.com. I should get back to you within a day or two. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I would love to have a chat with you about anything and everything, work related or not. 
- ⚡ Outside of work, I love to blog ([here](https://andenacitelli.medium.com/)), play guitar, cook, and run.
