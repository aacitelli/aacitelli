### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anden, a junior at Ohio State studying Computer Science & Engineering. I have dabbled in basically everything, but am most interested in web development and robotics. I will be interning with [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) Summer 2021, but am always open to offers! Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nlJzHsSkNTlFM0Xu_uAItzb8M-6_duzt/view?usp=sharing) for a quick overview of my work and accomplishments.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing software development optimizing 3D printing procedures for the [Ohio State Center for Design & Manufacturing Excellence](https://cdme.osu.edu/) and leading software development for Ohio State's Underwater Robotics Team ([@osu-uwrt](http://github.com/osu-uwrt)).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always open to inquiries of any sort and would love to grab a coffee or have a chat with you about anything and everything.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at andenacitelli@gmail.com. 
- âš¡ Outside of programming, I love to play the guitar and cook.

Here's some GitHub stats because numbers are cool:
