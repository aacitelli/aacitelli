### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anden, a junior at Ohio State studying Computer Science & Engineering. I will be interning with [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) next summer, but am always open to offers! I plan to graduate either Fall 2021 or Spring 2022 and will be open to offers around then, so feel free to get in touch (andenacitelli@gmail.com)! 

I have dabbled in basically everything, but am currently most interested in web development and robotics currently. Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nlJzHsSkNTlFM0Xu_uAItzb8M-6_duzt/view?usp=sharing) or my website [here](https://andenacitelli.com) for a quick overview of my work and accomplishments.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing 3D printing procedures for the [Ohio State Center for Design & Manufacturing Excellence](https://cdme.osu.edu/) and leading software development for Ohio State's Underwater Robotics Team ([@osu-uwrt](http://github.com/osu-uwrt)) on top of my course load.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at andenacitelli@gmail.com. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I would love to have a chat with you about anything and everything work-related or otherwise.
- âš¡ Outside of programming, I love to play guitar, cook, and run.
